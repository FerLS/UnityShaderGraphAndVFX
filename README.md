# Compilation of Shaders and VFX in Unity

Small VFX created using VfxGraph and ShaderGraph in Unity using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
A functional demo can be tested in the [releases section](https://github.com/FerLS/UnityShaderGraphAndVFX/releases/tag/1.0.0).

Not everything I did is showcased in the demo; refer to the project for more details.

## Disclaimer
Not all models are mine, and the VFX ideas are not all original.
